        <h2>Why It's Interesting</h2>
        <p>This career is especially interesting because it allows you to work at the cutting edge of biotechnology. As a computational biologist, you might work on developing new drugs, 
            understanding genetic disorders, or even helping to combat diseases like cancer.</p>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Computational biology has a wide range of applications. Beyond healthcare, it is used in agriculture to improve crop yields and resilience, in environmental science to study ecosystems and biodiversity, 
            and even in forensics for DNA analysis. </p>

        <h2>Interesting Information</h2>
        <p>The field of computational biology is ever-evolving. It includes fascinating subfields like genomics, proteomics, and systems biology. 
            The rapid advancements in technology are constantly pushing the boundaries of what we can understand and achieve. Computational Biology is progressive field where many students
        are working on their own research. For example, summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to work at Dr. Kheradvar Lab of the Massachussets Institute of Technology and use MATLAB to detech
        Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in Chicken Embryos. From here, this spark my interest in combing technology with biology research.</p>

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence Involvement</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in computational biology. AI algorithms are used to predict protein structures, analyze genetic sequences, and even simulate 
            biological processes. This integration of AI makes the field even more dynamic and impactful. These last two months, I had the opportunity to go to Regeneron International
        Science and Engineering Fair and I saw many of my peers at my age working on Computational Biology research involving AI. For example, many use AI and Comp Bio for Biomarkers to determine
        signs of suicide, dementia, and detecting neuron energy efficiency</p>

        <h2>Career Path</h2>
        <p>If you're passionate about biotechnology, studying computational biology can be a perfect fit. You'll need a strong foundation in both biology and computer science. 
            Many computational biologists have degrees in bioinformatics, computational biology, or related fields. Many of them end up getting an undergraduate degree and
        pursuing a master's degree. For example, my brother's best friend, Ally Novales, she pursued a degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research with a 
        minor in Computational Biology at UC Berkeley, now she works for Pfizer. </p>
